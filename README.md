## Open Source / Featured Projects

- **[Chaos Reviewer](https://github.com/amacharla15/CalhacksChaosReviewer)**  
  Fetch.ai-based code-review agent that condenses noisy build/test logs into one actionable fix summary + one “brain-rot” quip.  
  → ~7.2K interactions in 24 hours at Cal Hacks 12.0 (2nd most used agent, Fetch.ai track).

- **[University Marketplace](https://github.com/amacharla15/University-Marketplace)**  
  Django + PostgreSQL marketplace for campus buyers/sellers, containerized with Docker and deployed on GCP.  
  → Email-verified accounts, chat, appointment scheduling, listing management; 100+ users in first 24 hours.

- **[Hardware-Aware Training Time & Throughput Prediction](https://github.com/amacharla15/Hardware-Aware-Training-Time-Throughput-Prediction)**  
  Empirical job-time / throughput estimator for CIFAR-10 CNNs on an NVIDIA A100.  
  → Runs CNN grids on A100 and trains a dense ANN regressor to predict time/epoch and images/sec from configuration features.
