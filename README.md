# Hi, I'm Akshith 👋

**Backend Developer & ML/AI**

- M.S. Computer Science @ CSU Chico — 4.0 GPA (expected Dec 2026)  
- Ex-Programmer Analyst (Django) @ Cognizant (2.8+ years)  
- Focused on ML systems, hardware-aware training, agents, and developer tooling

---

## About Me

- Strong backend experience with Django/DRF, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GCP.  
- Interested in ML, AI infra, GPU performance, and developer experience tools.  
- Actively building agents, log-triage tools, and GPU-aware training pipelines.  
- Exploring hackathons, open-source contributions, and applied AI projects.

## Open Source / Featured Projects

- **[Chaos Reviewer](https://github.com/amacharla15/CalhacksChaosReviewer)**  
  Fetch.ai-based code-review agent that condenses noisy build/test logs into one actionable fix summary + one “brain-rot” quip.  
  → ~7.2K interactions in 24 hours at Cal Hacks 12.0 (2nd most used agent, Fetch.ai track).

- **[University Marketplace](https://github.com/amacharla15/University-Marketplace)**  
  Django + PostgreSQL marketplace for campus buyers/sellers, containerized with Docker and deployed on GCP.  
  → Email-verified accounts, chat, appointment scheduling, listing management; 100+ users in first 24 hours.

- **[Hardware-Aware Training Time & Throughput Prediction](https://github.com/amacharla15/Hardware-Aware-Training-Time-Throughput-Prediction)**  
  Empirical job-time / throughput estimator for CIFAR-10 CNNs on an NVIDIA A100.  
  → Runs CNN grids on A100 and trains a dense ANN regressor to predict time/epoch and images/sec from configuration features.

## Side Projects

- **[Audio Classification CNN](https://github.com/amacharla15/AudioClassificationCNN)**  
  Deep audio classifier for environmental sounds using PyTorch, Mel Spectrograms, and a ResNet-style CNN.  
  → FastAPI + Modal GPU inference with a Next.js dashboard for uploads, confidence scores, and feature-map visualizations.

- **[Handwriting Tutor (Camera + Computer Vision)](https://github.com/amacharla15/handwritingTutor-Computervision)**  
  Real-time handwriting tutor using webcam + raw computer vision (React + Vite, Canvas 2D).  
  → 4×5 grid of 64×64 cells with heuristic / TF.js recognizer that gives micro-coaching tips on digit shapes.

- **[Interactive Chess (SSR/MPA Django Game)](https://github.com/amacharla15/CSCI-598---Web-Development-Using-Python-and-Django)**  
  Single-player chess game implemented as a Django MPA with per-user state and Bootstrap UI.  
  → Server-side move handling, auth (join/login/logout), and Dockerized deployment on a GCP VM.

- **More in progress…**  
  Additional ML infra + developer tooling experiments (profilers, dashboards, agents).
